# Baxter: Box Sorting

CSCI 5551: Intelligent Robotics Systems Final Project

## Abstract 

Robots have the potential to benefit us by increasing efficiency, reducing labour-intensive tasks, and allowing humans to focus on more complex and higher-value activities. Sorting objects at a large scale is an excellent example of this. In this project, we use Rethink Roboticsâ€™ Baxter robot with ROS and OpenCV to identify and sort boxes. We use object detection with colour recognition and inverse kinematics to accurately move the boxes. We achieved our goal of sorting and stacking cubes of three different colours. The work can be further extended to objects of multiple shapes and sizes.
