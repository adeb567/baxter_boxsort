# Baxter: Box Sorting

CSCI 5551: Intelligent Robotics Systems Final Project

## Abstract 

Robots have the potential to benefit us by in002 creasing efficiency, reducing labour-intensive tasks, and allowing humans to focus on more complex and higher-value activities. Sorting objects at a large scale is an excellent exam006 ple of this. In this project, we use Rethink Roboticsâ€™ Baxter robot with ROS and OpenCV to identify and sort boxes. We use object de009 tection with colour recognition and inverse kinematics to accurately move the boxes. We achieved our goal of sorting and stacking cubes of three different colours. The work can be fur013 ther extended to objects of multiple shapes and sizes.
